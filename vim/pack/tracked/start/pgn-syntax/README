ABOUT

    Portable Game Notation or PGN is a standard way to record chess games.
    The 'pgn.vim' file provides syntax coloring for PGN files in Vim.

    The syntax file is based on Charles Ford's work:

        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=677

    I rewrote most of the syntax parsing making it more strict and adding new
    features such as support for comments and special characters in string
    values.

    PGN specification:

INSTALLATION

    Put the 'syntax/pgn.vim' file to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/ directory.
    Then you can use:

        :set syntax=pgn

    To use the syntax in the current buffer.

    To set the syntax automatically for certain file types, such as '.pgn' in
    this case, put the 'ftdetect/pgn.vim' in $VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/ directory.

    See ':help ftdetect' for more information.

    Alternatively you can use bundle manager such as Vundle or Pathogen.
